# TideTracker
Track tides and weather at local beach

Most of the code is from Sam Baker's project at: https://github.com/Ssabaker/TideTracker

Inspired by his article about the project here: https://www.hackster.io/ssbaker/e-ink-tide-and-weather-tracker-21447b 

Adapted to use a smaller screen available in the UK from thepihut here: https://thepihut.com/products/5-83-e-ink-display-hat-for-raspberry-pi-648x480

It also uses the UK tides API from: https://www.admiralty.co.uk/digital-services/data-solutions/uk-tidal-api

It's also my first time coding anything in Python, so be gentle!
