# TideTracker
Track tides and weather at local beach

Most of the code is from Sam Baker's project at https://github.com/Ssabaker/TideTracker and https://www.hackster.io/ssbaker/e-ink-tide-and-weather-tracker-21447b 

Adapted to use a smaller screen available in the UK from thepihut and also use a UK tides API.
